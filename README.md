## What I Learned So Far

- **Git Basics**: staging (`git add`), committing (`git commit`), pushing (`git push`), pulling (`git pull`), and merging (`git merge`).
- **Branching Strategies**: working with `main`, `dev`, and `feature/*` branches for clean collaboration.
- **Collaboration**: cloning repositories, keeping local code up to date with `git pull`, and contributing changes through commits and pushes.
- **Commit Practices**: importance of small, focused commits with clear commit messages.
- **Problem Solving**: how Git helps manage code versions, avoid conflicts, and support teamwork in development projects.
